# Preface {-}

The pre-requisite module MATH2010: Statistical Modelling I covered in detail the theory of linear
regression models, where explanatory variables are used to explain the variation in a
response variable, which is assumed to be normally distributed.

However, **in many practical situations the data are not appropriate for such analysis**.
For example, the response variable may be **binary**, and interest may be focused on
**assessing the dependence of the probability of 'success' on potential explanatory
variables**. Such techniques are important in many disciplines such as finance,
market research and medicine.

Alternatively, a variety of biological and
social science data are in the form of **cross-classified tables of counts**,
called contingency tables. The structure of such tables can be examined
to **determine the pattern of interdependence of the cross-classifying variables**.

**The aim of this module** is to cover the theory and application of what are known as
**generalised linear models** (GLMs). This is an extremely broad class of
statistical models, which incorporates the linear regression models studied in
MATH2010, but also allows binary or count response data to be modelled coherently.

The inference methods for the generalised linear models require extension of the theory
developed in MATH2010. In Chapter \@ref(prelim) we shall develop or review the general
likelihood based theory for estimation and model comparison. We shall also
show that the inference methods used for linear and multiple regression models are
special cases of this general theory. 

The generalised linear model will be introduced in Chapter \@ref(glm) and we will develop
general estimation and model comparison techniques by appealing to the 
likelihood-based theory discussed in Chapter \@ref(prelim). Finally, 
Chapter \@ref(chap:categorical) will apply the techniques to
analyse dependence structures in multiway cross-classified
tables known as contingency tables. The weekly practical classes will 
demonstrate how to use `R` to fit these models to real data sets.
